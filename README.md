# Spring-Framework
Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise Java. Millions of developers around the world use Spring Framework to create high performing, easily testable, and reusable code.

Spring framework is an open source Java platform. It was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003.

Spring is lightweight when it comes to size and transparency. The basic version of Spring framework is around 2MB.

The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform. Spring framework targets to make
J2EE development easier to use and promotes good programming practices by enabling a POJO-based programming model.

* Spring enables the developers to develop enterprise applications using POJOs (Plain Old Java Object). The benefit of developing the applications using POJO is, that we do not need to have an enterprise container such as an application server but we have the option of using a robust servlet container.
* Spring provides an abstraction layer on existing technologies like servlets, jsps, jdbc, jndi, rmi, jms and Java mail etc., to simplify the develpment process.
* Spring comes with some of the existing technologies like ORM framework, logging framework, J2EE and JDK Timers etc, Hence we don’t need to integrate explicitly those technologies.
* Spring WEB framework has a well-designed  web MVC framework, which provides a great alternate to lagacy web framework.
* Spring can eliminate the creation of the singleton and factory classes.
* Spring provides a consistent transaction management interface that can scale down to a local transaction and scale up to global transactions (using JTA).
* Spring framework includes support for managing business objects and exposing their services to the presentation tier components, so that the web and desktop applications can access the same objects.
* Spring framework has taken the best practice that have been proven over the years in several applications and formalized as design patterns.
* Spring application can be used for the development of different kind of applications, like standalone applications, standalone GUI applications, Web applications and applets as well.
* Spring supports both xml and anotation configurations.
* Spring Framework allows to develop standalone, desktop, 2 tire – n-tire architecture and distributed applications.
* Spring gives built in middleware services like Connection pooling, Transaction management and etc.,
* Spring provides a light weight container which can be activaed without using webserver or application server.
